# Computer Vision RPS
# MIlestone 2: 
Created a computer vision system, or model using Teachable-Machine website. On the website I created 4 classes: 'none' class with just my pictures. Then I trained 3 classes, rock, paper, and scissors, with images of yourself showing each option to the camera. The "None" class represents the lack of option in the image. 

Downloaded the model from the "Tensorflow" tab in Teachable-Machine. 

The files contain the structure and the parameters of a deep learning model. They are not files that can be run, and they do not contain anything readable if you look inside. Pushed the model and labels to my GitHub repository after committing.
