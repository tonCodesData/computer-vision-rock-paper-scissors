# Computer Vision RPS
# MIlestone 2: 
Created a computer vision system, or model using Teachable-Machine website. On the website I created 4 classes: 'none' class with just my pictures. Then I trained 3 classes, rock, paper, and scissors, with images of yourself showing each option to the camera. The "None" class represents the lack of option in the image.
